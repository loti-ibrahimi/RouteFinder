# RouteFinder
This is a small app that basically takes in two locations - starting point &amp; a destination, then giving the user the following options:  * - Give the shortest route between the two (distance wise).  * - Show all possible routes between the two.  * - Give the quickest route between the two (time wise).     *   *A database of other routes may be brought in therefore having a greater possibility of user location inputs!
